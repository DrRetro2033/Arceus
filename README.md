# What is Arceus?

Arceus is a brand new CLI (Command Line Interface) save manager and editor designed to make it easy to manage your saves all in one place.

# Features

## Branch Off Into Different Universes 🌌

With Arceus, you can branch saves into new universes, so multiple versions of one save can exist at the same time.

## Rollback to Older Saves 🕔

Arceus can rollback saves to older versions, so if you make any mistakes, your original savefile is still intact.

## Human Readable 👓

With file patterns, you can make binary and hexadecimals readable and modify them with ease.

# Use Cases

## For Save Editors 📝

The main use case for Arceus is for developers can use Arceus in their save editor to make it easier to focus on what actually matters, the user experience. If you want an example of what you can do with Arceus, check out my other project [MudkiPC](https://github.com/Pokemon-Manager/MudkiPC).

## For Game Development 💻

Be able to rollback to any point in your game for testing, without having to write debug menus.

## For Multiple Players 🫂

No matter if a game supports multiple saves or not, Arceus can make it easier to have multiple players have their own experience.

## For Achievement Hunting 🏆

Jump from point to point, so you can easily collect every achievement in a game.

# Why is it called Arceus?

The reason I called this program is called Arceus is because Arceus is the literal god of Pokémon, and they have the ability to effect time and space. It is also because this is a large compontent of my other project [MudkiPC](https://github.com/Pokemon-Manager/MudkiPC), which is Pokémon related.

# Consider Sponsoring ❤️

I would love to continue working on this for the foreseeable future, however, I am currently in school and this project is a lot of work. Consider sponsoring me on GitHub so I can continue working on this project! If you can't, no worries, you can spread the word about this project instead. Thanks!
