<!-- This file is an example of an uncompressed SERE kit file for testing and rough blueprint of the file layout. -->

<!-- 
The 'sere' tag acts as the header for the file.
It contains small data such as a constellation, a star tree, addon info, users, and more.
All archives and files must always be seperate to this, and only loaded when needed.
-->
<sere> 
    <!-- The 'const' tag is an abbrivation of 'Constellation', and contains the name of the constellation, the current star, and more. -->
    <const name="Test Constellation">
        <!-- The 'star' tag represents a star in a constellation. It contains the star name, its children, its commit hash (aka. archive hash), and more.  -->
        <star name="Initial Star" comit="00000000000000000000000000000000">
        </star>
    </const>
</sere>

<!-- 
The 'archive' tag represents a group of files stored in the sere kit. 
Each archive gets an unique hash so it can be referenced.
Hashes can range from 0, all the way to 3.4028237e+38, 
which should be more than enough to store multiple archives in one sere kit.
 -->
<archive hash="00000000000000000000000000000000">
<!-- 
The 'file' tag contains the relative path of the file in the archive, and its data is stored in compressed base64.

It path should be relative to the archive, so for instance:
"C://path/to/folder/example.txt" will translate to "example.txt".

If a file is in a subfolder, you can represent that by adding the subfolder to the path:
"C://path/to/folder/subfolder/example.txt" will translate to "subfolder/example.txt".

-->
    <file path="example-path"></file>
