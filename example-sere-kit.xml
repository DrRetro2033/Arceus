<!-- This file is an example of an uncompressed SERE kit file for testing and rough blueprint of the file layout. -->

<!-- 
The 'sere' tag acts as the header for the file.
It contains small data such as constellation infomation, the star tree, addon data, and more.
-->
<sere> 
    <!-- The 'const' tag is an abbrivation of 'Constellation', and contains the name of the constellation, the current star, and more. -->
    <const name="Test Constellation">
        <!-- The 'star' tag represents a star in a constellation. It contains the star name, its children, its commit hash, and more.  -->
        <star name="Initial Star" comit="ffffffff">
        </star>
    </const>
</sere>

<!-- 
The 'comit' tag is a commited version of a file system. 
It contains files, which could be extremely big, so they are seperate to the header, and will only be loaded into memory when needed.
-->
<comit hash="ffffffff">
    <file path="test/test.txt">
    </file>
